        <li>There are so many from he was a little baby I wouldn't know where to begin. His love, his smile, and loving kindness. In my heart forever my Kiochio. All my love, Great auntie Barbara ❤️ ♥️</li>
        <li>Kyle made me feel more seen and understood in our first two conversations than others who have known me for years. He always encouraged my art, my expression, and celebrated my writing. One night we were on FaceTime late, he was having a hard day and talking about it until he saw my cat came in through the window- his entire face lit up, his attitude changed instantly and he screamed “OMG KITTY” before changing to talk about his time on farms with cats. He felt things deeply in a world obsessed with numbness, and may I have the courage to live half as fully as this beautiful man. Rest in power, my lovely black stray cat of a friend. Love, Margret</li>
        <li>The Guffey family used to throw big Christmas parties at the holidays when everyone was in town. It was a mix of young people and mom's friends too. One year, I asked Kyle to make a playlist of music to play at the party. He burned a CD called Kyle's Mix. We put it in the CD player and it was a great mix of party tunes that everyone was enjoying. About 30min into the music, the dirtiest, raunchiest gangster rap song came on - explicit version. I immediately looked around the crowd for him and he was staring at me with this mischievous grin. He had been waiting to see the reaction and knew exactly when the song was going to come up. Then we both started laughing because two of my mom's older friends were dancing to it in the living room. I still have that CD. - Kelly Guffey</li>
        <li>Kyle was 1 of my 3 best friends growing up, we were a crew, spent everyday together. I will miss him dearly and forever wish we could have reconnected as adults. Love you Kyle</li>
        <li>Sending love your way simone. I put fresh flowers on your alter today. Thank you for so many years- the trust and vulnerability. The flourless raspberry cakes and endless assortments of flowers. Military style sheet folding and daily check ins, years of check ins. I will always hold you close to My heart. Wishing your family peace and comfort during this grieving process</li>
        <li>My deepest condolences to the family and friends in this extremely hard time.<br><br>From the days on end on the phone without hanging up, to the laughs and tears we both shared - I will cherish every moment I was able to have with Kyle, he changed my life.<br><br>I'll miss the terrible Australian accent he attempted to do, watching him cook, the long discussions about film, music and life - the way he was so passionate about everything he did and the way he loved and cared so whole heartedly.<br><br>Kyle, you showed me how to love, how to open up, how to let my walls down and truly be myself.<br><br>Words can't describe just how much my life and future meant with you in it - you mean the world to me.<br><br>I will love and miss you forever xxx</li>
        <li>Kyle taught me self-confidence. There were so many lessons from this man in the years we lived together but this one stands out. Kyle knew who he was and wasn't afraid to be his true self.<br><br>I was filled with self-doubt and Kyle gave me the confidence to ask myself...why? I grew into somebody who was more willing to be who I am without that doubt and I wouldn't have gotten there without Kyle.<br><br>Loved dipping the old school whip with the drop top the summer we lived together after our freshman year of college back in Phoenix.<br><br>I love you Kyle</li>
