        <li>There are so many from he was a little baby I wouldn't know where to begin. His love, his smile, and loving kindness. In my heart forever my Kiochio. All my love, Great auntie Barbara ❤️ ♥️</li>
        <li>Kyle made me feel more seen and understood in our first two conversations than others who have known me for years. He always encouraged my art, my expression, and celebrated my writing. One night we were on FaceTime late, he was having a hard day and talking about it until he saw my cat came in through the window- his entire face lit up, his attitude changed instantly and he screamed “OMG KITTY” before changing to talk about his time on farms with cats. He felt things deeply in a world obsessed with numbness, and may I have the courage to live half as fully as this beautiful man. Rest in power, my lovely black stray cat of a friend. Love, Margret</li>
